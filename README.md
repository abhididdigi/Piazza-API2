[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/piazza-api.png)](http://badge.fury.io/py/piazza-api)

Unofficial Client for Piazza's Internal API


This is an fork of the unofficial API with a fix that now makes the API to work. (CSRF vulnerability)

Step 1: Open up chrome console and go to network task, and then login into Piazza

Step 2: in the Request Headers for a sample API request, you'll see a new header called `CSRF-Token`.
 
Step 3: Expose this as environment variable on OSX you can do `export piazza_session_id = <token above>`

Step 4: Use the API as you were using it before. 






## Usage

```python
>>> from piazza_api import Piazza
>>> p = Piazza()
>>> p.user_login()
Email: ...
Password: ...

>>> user_profile = p.get_user_profile()

>>> eece210 = p.network("hl5qm84dl4t3x2")

>>> eece210.get_post(100)
...

>>> posts = eece210.iter_all_posts(limit=10)
>>> for post in posts:
...     do_awesome_thing(post)

>>> users = eece210.get_users(["userid1", "userid2"])
>>> all_users = eece210.get_all_users()
```

Above are some examples to get started; more in the documentation (which is coming soon; 
but the code is all Sphinx-style documented and is fairly readable).

You can also use the "internal" PiazzaRPC class which maps more directly
to Piazza's API itself but is not as nice and as intuitive to use as the
`Piazza` class abstraction.

```python
>>> from piazza_api.rpc import PiazzaRPC
>>> p = PiazzaRPC("hl5qm84dl4t3x2")
>>> p.user_login()
Email: ...
Password: ...
>>> p.content_get(181)
...
>>> p.add_students(["student@example.com", "anotherStudent@example.com"])
...
```
